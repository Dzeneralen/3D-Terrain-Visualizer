3D-Terrain-Visualizer
=====================

3D Terrain Visualizer created using JavaScript and WebGL. Takes input in the form of either manual input or a file containing 
indexes and values on a matrix Grid. After the input is recieved the program interpolates a Height Grid using Laplace's Finitie differentail
equation with the Neumann boundary condition to create a 3D model from the input.
