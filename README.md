3D-Terrain-Visualizer 
=====================

_3D Terrain Visualizer_ created using _JavaScript_ and _WebGL_. Takes input in the form of either manual input or a file containing indexes and values on a matrix Grid. After the input is recieved the program interpolates a Height Grid using Laplace's Finitie differential equation with the Neumann boundary condition to create a 3D model from the input.
